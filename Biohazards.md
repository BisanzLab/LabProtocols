# Safe Handling and Disposal of Biohazardous Agents


## Handling BSL2 Cultures

### Aerobes

All manipulations of BSL2 aerobes which could create aerosoles (ex vortexing) should be conducted in a Biosafety Cabinet to prevent spread. The user should wear appropriate PPE (nitrile gloves, lab coat and glasses) and avoid blocking the entire back of the hood which can disrupt air flow. Discard all materials inside the BSC into the red biohazardous disposal bin inside the hood. When you finish your work, wipe down the work surfaces with 70ËšC Ethanol and turn the UV light on for at least 30 minutes. Discard gloves in biohazardous trash. Cultures can be grown in the incubators in 304C; however, manipulations of said cultures should be done in the biological safety cabinet.

### Anaerobes

Manipulation of facultative anaerobes or aerotolerant anaerobes should be conducted as per Aerobes in a biological safety cabinet. For obligate anaerobes, manipulate all cultures inside of Coy Anaerobic Chamber. Before and after work, wipe all surfaces down with 100% isopropanol. All materials which contact cultures inside the coy should be discarded into the biohazardous bin inside the anaerobic chamber. When this garbage is full, tie it closed and transfer to large autoclave bin in main lab. Liquid cultures should be decontaminated for 60 minutes with 10% v/v bleach and NaOH...
