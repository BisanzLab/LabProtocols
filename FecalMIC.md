# Fecal Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assay protocol
## Goal:
To determine the effects of anti-malarial drugs, Artemisinin (Art) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), on the growth of microbes in human fecal samples

## Preparation of drug stocks:
1.  Dissolve Art in DMF at concentration of 25.6 mg/mL
2.	Dissolve HCQ in mqH2O at concentration of 25.6 mg/mL
3.	Filter-sterilize both stocks

## Preparation of plate:

Note: Can be done a day in advance on the bench. Place the prepared plate in the anaerobic chamber 24 hours before the experiment. If preparing plate on the day of the experiment, prepare plate in the anaerobic chamber. 

1.	In a deep well 96-well plate, add 1mL of media (BIH CHV or mGAM) to each well in two columns
2.	Add additional 980 uL of media to the first row only
3.	Add 20uL of drug stock to the first row only
    1.	The first row now contains total 2 mL and 1% drug stock (256 ug/mL)
4.	Serially dilute the media containing the drug by pipetting 1 mL and dispensing onto the next row.
    1.	The well plate should contain the following drug concentrations:

| Artemisinin | Hydroxychloroquine |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 256 ug/mL   | 256 ug/mL          |
| 128 ug/mL   | 128 ug/mL          |
| 64 ug/mL   | 64 ug/mL          |
| 32 ug/mL   | 32 ug/mL          |
| 16 ug/mL   | 16 ug/mL          |
| 8 ug/mL   | 8 ug/mL          |
| 4 ug/mL   | 4 ug/mL          |
| 0 ug/mL   | 0 ug/mL          |

5.	Using a multi-channel pipette, transfer 200 uL of drug containing media onto 250uL 96-well plate
    1.	Add Art containing media onto column 1-6
    2.	Add HCQ containing media onto column 7-12
6.	Place the plate in anaerobic chamber 24 hours before the experiment if prepared on the bench

## Preparation of fecal samples:

1.	Take 100mg aliquot of fecal sample out of -80c freezer and into the anaerobic chamber
2.	Place the aliquot in a tube with 1mL media (BIH CHV or mGAM)
3.	Vortex for 5-10 sec to homogenize the fecal sample
4.	Let the homogenized mixture sit for a few minutes to let the solids settle

## Experimental Protocol

Note: Must be done in the anaerobic chamber

1.	Using a multi-channel pipette, transfer 1 uL of fecal sample to the prepared plate
    1.	Do NOT pipette the fecal samples into columns 6 and 12. These will be the sterile controls
    2.	Each well should contain 0.5% sample
2.	The plate should follow the scheme below:

3.	Carefully place the cover on the plate and tape around the edges to seal the plate
4.	Place the plate into the plate reader
5.	Set up the plate with the following parameters:
    1.	Kinetic loop set for 24 hours
    2.	Read every 15 minutes
    3.	Shake for 30 sec before reading
6.	When finished, save and export the data
