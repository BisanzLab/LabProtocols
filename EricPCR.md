# ERIC PCR Protocol

## Background
This SOP describes how to carry out ERIC PCR to differentiate strains based on a random PCR creating strain-variable banding patterns.
This protocl is based on  Ventura and Zink (FEMS Microbiology Letters 2002). Note: This protocl in theory was designed to amplify a feature of The *E. coli* genome, but really is just randomly amplifying the genomic DNA. 


## Materials
- [ ] Instagene Matrix (Biorad #732-6030)
- [ ] Wide bore 200 µL pipette tips (or clean scissors to cut tip off end of normal tip)
- [ ] 1.5 mL nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes
- [ ] nuclease-free water or PBS
- [ ] 200 µL PCR tubes
- [ ] Waterbath/heatblock/PCR thermocycler capable of 56˚C and 100˚C
- [ ] Amplitaq Gold 360 Master Mix (Life Tech/Thermofisher 4398881)
- [ ] ERIC1R primer (5-ATGTAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC-3) at 100 µM
- [ ] ERIC2 primer (5-AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-3) at 100 µM
- [ ] Nuclease/DNA free H2O
- [ ] Waterbath and/or heatblocks set to 56˚C and 100 ˚C

## 3. DNA Extraction
- [ ] Pick a single colony from a freshly prepared culture plate and resuspend
in 1mL of PBS or sterile H2O in a microcentrifuge tube **OR** Transfer 200ul from a broth culture to a microcentrigue tube.
- [ ] Centrifuge at ~10,000 xg for 1 minute.
- [ ] Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 100 µL of Instagene matrix (matrix should be well mixed and use wide bore tips)
- [ ] Mix thoroughly by vortexing
- [ ] Incubate at 56˚C for 30 minutes
- [ ] Mix thoroughly by vortexing
- [ ] Incubate at 100˚C for 8 minutes
- [ ] Mix thoroughly by vortexing
- [ ] Centrifuge for 3 minutes at max (~16,000 xg)
- [ ] Transfer 60 µL of the supernatant containing gDNA to a new
microcentrifuge tube. This is optional and supernatant can be used directly for PCR.
- [ ] Store gDNA at -20˚C for long term storage or 4˚C for short term.

## 4. PCR

- [ ] Prepare a master mix for PCR as outlined in Table 4.1.
- [ ] Add 1 µL of gDNA for a total reaction volume of 20 µL. Be sure to include a reaction with 1 µL of H2O as no template control (NTC).
- [ ] Pop spin to remove any air bubbles.
- [ ] Run the PCR using the PCR cycle parameters indicated in Table 4.2

Cycle |	Temperature (˚C)  | Time
------|-------------------|------
Initial Denaturation   |	95	| 10 min
35 cycles:

Anneal | 48˚C	| 60 sec
Extend | 72˚C | 4 min
Holding	| 4˚C	Hold | 0 sec

## 4. Interpretation

Compare banding patterns across gel. If two strains are related they will share many bands, and if two strains are identical, they will have identical banding patterns.
