# Genomic DNA Purification From Gram-Positive Bacteria
## Theory
This protocol was adapted from New England BioLabs' Genomic DNA Purification from Gram-positive Bacteria and Archaea. The goal of using this kit is to extract higher concentrations of gDNA from gram-positive bacteria. 
## Materials
- [ ] Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (T3010L)
- [ ] Lysozyme (25 mg/mL)
- [ ] PBS or 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0
- [ ] Thermal mixer or heating block
- [ ] Microcentrifuge tubes
- [ ] Nuclease-free water
## Protocol
Part 1

1. Harvest 2 x 10 <sup>9</sup> (~2-3 medium sized colonies or 1 mL liquid culture) gram-positive bacteria by centrifugation for 1 minute at >12,000 rpm. Remove supernantant. 
2. Add 80 μl of PBS or 10 mM  Tris-CI pH 8.0 and resuspend bacterial pellet by vortexing. 
3. Add 20 μl Lysozyme solution and vortex briefly, then add 100 μl Tissue Lysis Buffer and vortex thoroughly. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes. 
4. Add 10 μl Proteinase K, vortex briefly, and incubate at 56°C for 30 minutes in a thermal mixer with agitation at full speed (~1400 rpm). 
5. Add 3 μl of RNase A to the lysate, vortex briefly, and incubate for a minimum of 5 minutes at 56°C with agitation at full speed. 
6. Proceed to Genomic DNA Binding and Elution. 

Part 2- Genomic DNA Binding and Elution

1. Add 400 μl gDNA Binding Buffer to the sample and mix thoroughly by pulse-vortexing for 5-10 seconds. 
2. Transfer the lysate/binding buffer mix (~600 μl) to a gDNA Purification Column pre-inserted into a collection tube, without touching the upper column area. Proceed to step 3 immediately.
3. Close the cap and centrifuge: first for 3 minutes at 1,000 xg to bind the gDNA. Centrifuge again for 1 minute at maximum speed (>12,000 xg) to clear the membrane. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube. 
4. Transfer column to a new collection tube and add 500 μl gDNA Wash Buffer. Close the cap and invert a few times, so the was buffer reaches the cap. Centrifuge immediately for 1 minute at maximum speed (>12,000 xg), and discard the flow through. 
5. Reinsert the column into the collection tube. Add 500 μl gDNA Wash Buffer and close the cap. Centrifuge immediately for 1 minute at maximum speed (>12,000 xg), then discard the collection tube and flow through.
6. Transfer the column into a DNase-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 1 minute at maximum speed (>12,000 xg) to pull off any additional ethanol. 
7. Place the gDNA Purification Column into a new DNase-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 35-100 μl gDNA Elution Buffer or nuclease-free water. Close the cap and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Elution in 100 μl is recommended, but smaller volumes can be used and will result in more concentrated DNA.
8. Centrifgue for 1 minute at maximum speed (>12,000 xg) to elute the gDNA.  
9. Store gDNA at -20°C for short-term storage.
