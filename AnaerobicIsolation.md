# Isolation of New Strains from Human/Mouse Fecal Samples

## Background

This protocol describes a method for isolating new bacteria from fecal samples. The goal is to diversify the lab culture collection to enable us It uses multiple types of rich/selective media to try to enrich different populations. This isolates can then be identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and stored as frozen glycerol stocks in the freezer for future experiments. *Note: all materials should be placed in the anaerobic chamber 1-2 days ahead of time to ensure they have degassed their oxygen content*.

## Materials
- [ ] Fecal sample (~100mg aliquot that has been flash frozen at -80˚C).
- [ ] PBS + 0.1% L-cysteine hydrochloride (autoclaved)
- [ ] One plate per sample of each media in **Table 1**
- [ ] 20 µL tips
- [ ] 20 µL pipette
- [ ] Anaerobic chamber running 5% Hydrogen, 10-20% carbon dioxide, balance Nitrogen

# Protocol

## Day 1
- [ ] Add 1mL of reduced PBS to 100mg feces aliquot
- [ ] Vortex well to mix
- [ ] Using disposable loop or pipette tip, do four quadrant streak on each of the plates in **Table 1**
- [ ] Incubate plates for 4-7 days at 37˚C in anaerobic chamber

## Day 4
- [ ] Inspect plates for growth noting the number of different colonies which differ in their morphology (shape, colour, edges, texture) and transfer 1 plate for each colony into the anaerobic chamber. Label each plate according to the sample of origin, the media on which it grew, and a unique number. For example: BZH16 mGAM2
