# Isolation of New Strains from Human/Mouse Fecal Samples

## Background

This protocol describes a method for isolating new bacteria from fecal samples. The goal is to diversify the lab culture collection to enable us It uses multiple types of rich/selective media to try to enrich different populations. This isolates can then be identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and stored as frozen glycerol stocks in the freezer for future experiments. *Note: all materials should be placed in the anaerobic chamber 1-2 days ahead of time to ensure they have degassed their oxygen content*.

## Materials
- [ ] Fecal sample (~100mg aliquot that has been flash frozen at -80˚C).
- [ ] PBS + 0.1% L-cysteine hydrochloride (autoclaved)
- [ ] mGAM broth
- [ ] One plate per sample of each media in **Table 1**
- [ ] 20 µL tips
- [ ] 20 µL pipette
- [ ] Sterile falcon tubes (VWR 60819-524)
- [ ] Crimp Top Vials (Sigma 854964)
- [ ] Crimp Seals (Sigma 854144)
- [ ] Crimping Device (Ex. Sigma Z114243-1EA)
- [ ] 1.5 mL Cryovial (External threads, ex Simport T310-2A)
- [ ] Appropriate growth media
- [ ] Sterile 50% glycerol (mix 50:50 with water and autoclave)
- [ ] Anaerobic chamber running 5% Hydrogen, 10-20% carbon dioxide, balance Nitrogen

# Protocol

## Day 1
- [ ] Add 1mL of reduced PBS to 100mg feces aliquot
- [ ] Vortex well to mix
- [ ] Using disposable loop or pipette tip, do four quadrant streak on each of the plates in **Table 1**
- [ ] Incubate plates for 4-7 days at 37˚C in anaerobic chamber

## Day 4
- [ ] Inspect plates for growth noting the number of different colonies which differ in their morphology (shape, colour, edges, texture) and transfer 2 plates for each unique colony into the anaerobic chamber. Label each plate according to the sample of origin, the media on which it grew, and a unique number. For example: BZH16 mGAM2.

## Day 5
- [ ] Using a Pipette tip, pick a single well-isolated colony from the original plate and do a quadrant streak on a new plate (of the same type) to purify. 
- [ ] Incubate new plate at 37˚C for 72h.

## Day 8
- [ ] Inspect the new plates to ensure that the colonies are homogenous in morphology.
- [ ] Using a pipette tip, pick a single colony from new plates and four quadrant streak onto a new plate (of the same type) to further purify and ensure that we will have a single isolate in the future.
- [ ] Incubate new plate at 37˚C for 24-72h depending on speed of growth of organism.
- [ ] Aliquot 3 mL of mGAM into 1 falcon tube per isolate (plus 1 more for a sterile control) and move to anaerobic chamber

## Day 11
- [ ] Transfer a single colony from the third round of streak purification into 3mL mGAM.
- [ ] Note the colony morphology and approximate growth rate of the culture in your lab notebook.
- [ ] Incubate for 2-3 days.

## Day 13-Day 14
- [ ] Transfer 200 µL of liquid culture to a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube to proceed to sanger [16S rRNA sequencing](https://github.com/BisanzLab/LabProtocols/blob/main/Isolate_16S.md). *Note: this can be frozen at -80˚C and processed later*.
- [ ] Transfer 1mL of liquid culture to each of a crimp top vial and a screw top vial
- [ ] Add 0.5 mL 50% glycerol to each tube and mix by pipetting
- [ ] Seal both vials
- [ ] Using a marker label the cryovials (ex BZH16 mGAM2)
- [ ] Remove vials and transfer to a rack in the -80˚C freezer

## Day X
- [ ] After Sanger sequencing, enter the strain into the main lab collection sheet (see #strains on slack). Include all relevant information and a copy of the 16S sequence.
- [ ] Print a label with the Species, Strain, Box Position, and Date of Preparation.
- [ ] Breifly remove stock from -80˚C, wipe surface with ethanol-damp paper towel and affix the label. 
- [ ] Transfer the cryovial to the lab strain collection working stocks, and the crimp top of the archival stocks.
