# Isolation of New Strains from Human/Mouse Fecal Samples

## Background

This protocol describes a method for isolating new bacteria from fecal samples. The goal is to diversify the lab culture collection to enable us It uses multiple types of rich/selective media to try to enrich different populations. This isolates can then be identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and stored as frozen glycerol stocks in the freezer for future experiments. *Note: all materials should be placed in the anaerobic chamber 1-2 days ahead of time to ensure they have degassed their oxygen content*.

## Materials
- [ ] Fecal sample (~100mg aliquot that has been flash frozen at -80ËšC).
- [ ] PBS + 0.1% L-cysteine hydrochloride (autoclaved)
- [ ] Growth Medias (see Table 1)
